# Sublime JSX

This is a simple (and crude) implementation of JSX syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 3 that extends the default JavaScript patterns.

Currently all of the JSX syntax highlighting packages depend on the ES6 highlighting from Babel and/or JavaScriptNext packages which do not use the correct scopes for highlighting JavaScript files.
